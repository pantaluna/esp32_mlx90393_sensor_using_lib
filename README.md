## Project Description
This project demonstrates the basics of using the MJD component "mjd_mlx90393" for the popular **Melexis MLX90393 magnetic field sensor** using the **I2C Bus**.

Use it to get insights in how to use this component.

Goto the component "components/mjd_mlx90393" for documentation, installation and wiring instructions, data sheets, FAQ, photo's, etc..



## Running the example
- Run `make menuconfig` and modify the GPIO PIN#'s that you want to use in the section "MY PROJECT CONFIGURATION". You can also change the log level: use level INFO for normal operation, use level DEBUG for more detailed logging and to get insights in what the component is doing.
- Run `make flash monitor` to build and upload the example to your board and connect to its serial terminal.



## Reference: the ESP32 MJD Starter Kit SDK

Do you also want to create innovative IoT projects that use the ESP32 chip, or ESP32-based modules, of the popular company Espressif? Well, I did and still do. And I hope you do too.

The objective of this well documented Starter Kit is to accelerate the development of your IoT projects for ESP32 hardware using the ESP-IDF framework from Espressif and get inspired what kind of apps you can build for ESP32 using various hardware modules.
